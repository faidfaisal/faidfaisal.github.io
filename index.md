## About Me

Hi there! I’m a third-year undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University. I’m very fortunate to be advised by **[Professor Alex Doboli](https://www.ece.stonybrook.edu/~adoboli/)**, where I am currently working on developing machine learning and NLP algorithms to assist with student grading, automation, and instructional support systems.

My academic interests lie at the **intersection of machine learning, computer architecture, and compiler design**. I am particularly passionate about designing and optimizing **hardware-accelerated systems for machine learning**, where algorithms, compilers, and processors are co-designed to maximize performance, efficiency, and scalability.

I plan to pursue a **PhD in Computer Engineering** and continue research in **artificial intelligence, machine learning, and systems-level optimization**, driven by a desire to understand how intelligent algorithms can be effectively mapped to modern computing architectures.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning Acceleration**: Designing hardware and software co-optimized solutions to efficiently accelerate ML workloads on CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and custom accelerators.  
- **Computer Architecture**: Investigating how processor design, memory hierarchies, and interconnect architectures impact the performance and efficiency of modern ML workloads.  
- **Compiler and Systems Design**: Exploring compiler optimizations, scheduling techniques, and system-level strategies to bridge the gap between ML algorithms and hardware for maximal performance.  
- **ML-Driven System Optimization**: Leveraging machine learning techniques to improve system-level decision-making, automation, and overall performance efficiency.
  
## News

- **[Dec. 2025]** Accepted a **Test Engineering Intern** offer at **EV Buddy**.  
- **[Nov. 2025]** Appointed **Machine Learning Lead** at **CRIZM**, overseeing AI-driven initiatives.  
- **[Nov. 2025]** Presented a research poster at the **Mid-Atlantic Section (MAS) ASEE Conference** on my CNN-based breast cancer detection model.  
- **[Aug. 2024]** Completed a Software Engineering internship at **JP Morgan Chase & Co.**, developing interactive trading dashboards and reducing onboarding time by 40%.  
- **[Aug. 2022]** Completed a System Operations internship at **iRobot**, leading robot design and reducing hardware–software interface failure rates by 20%.

  
## Projects

### Four-Stage Pipelined Multimedia Processor  
**Aug 2025 – Dec 2025**  

I designed a **four-stage pipelined processor (IF/ID/EX/WB)** using a structural RTL approach, incorporating a **128-bit multimedia ALU** that enables parallel processing of multiple subwords. The processor features a **32 × 128-bit register file** with multiple read and write ports, along with a **forwarding unit** that prevents execution stalls and improves pipeline efficiency. To ensure correctness, I developed a **cycle-accurate testbench** and a **custom assembler**, which together verified the processor’s functionality end-to-end.

### Transformer-Based NLP Chatbot with Intent Recognition  
**Jul 2025 – Aug 2025**  

I built a **transformer-based chatbot** capable of understanding and responding to multiple user intents. To prepare the data, I developed a **data pipeline** that handles text preprocessing, including tokenization and embeddings. I also created a **simple interactive frontend** for real-time conversations, while implementing **attention mechanisms and dropout** to improve accuracy and reliability. The chatbot was thoroughly tested with diverse inputs to ensure it responds correctly across a variety of scenarios.

### CNN-Based Breast Cancer Histopathology Classification  
**Jun 2025 – Jul 2025**  

I developed a **CNN in PyTorch** to classify breast cancer tissue images, achieving **95.9% training accuracy**. The network was designed with multiple **convolutional and pooling layers** to automatically extract key features from high-resolution images. I also built a **Gradio interface** that allows users to upload images and view predictions, with highlighted regions showing which areas influenced the results. To improve performance and robustness, I created a **training workflow** incorporating data augmentation and normalization.

## Beyond Academics

Outside of coursework and research, I enjoy activities that keep me active, sharp, and inspired. I regularly work out at the gym and play basketball, which help me stay physically fit and mentally focused. I also enjoy playing chess, as it challenges my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills. Traveling is another passion of mine, as exploring new places and experiencing different cultures gives me fresh perspectives and keeps me motivated.


## Advice

I am very grateful for the advice, talks, essays, and ideas I have read, watched, and learned from over the years. Many of them come from people I deeply admire and have shaped my philosophy, how I approach problems, and how I want to live my life. A common theme across all of them is the importance of **continuous improvement**.

This aligns closely with the Japanese concept of **Kaizen (改善)** — the practice of making **small, consistent improvements over time**. Whether in research, learning, fitness, or life, Kaizen reminds me that meaningful progress comes from steady effort rather than sudden breakthroughs.
