## About Me

Hi there! I’m a third-year undergraduate student studying **Computer Engineering at Cornell University**. I’m very fortunate to be advised by **[Professor David Bindel](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~bindel/)**, where I am currently working on developing **machine learning and NLP algorithms** to assist with **student grading, automation, and instructional support systems**.

My academic interests are centered on the **intersection of machine learning, computer architecture, and embedded systems**. I am particularly interested in building systems where learning algorithms are tightly integrated with hardware to improve performance, efficiency, and scalability.

I plan to pursue a **PhD in Computer Engineering** and continue research in **artificial intelligence and machine learning**, motivated by a strong interest in understanding how intelligent algorithms can be designed, optimized, and deployed within real computing systems.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning × Hardware:** How can machine learning algorithms be co-designed with hardware to improve efficiency, scalability, and performance?
- **Computer Architecture:** How do architectural choices in processors and memory systems impact the execution of modern ML workloads?
- **Embedded Systems:** How can intelligent algorithms be deployed on resource-constrained embedded platforms for real-world applications?
- **ML-Driven Systems:** How can learning-based approaches enhance automation, decision-making, and system-level optimization?

## News

- **[Dec. 2025]** Accepted a **Test Engineering Intern** offer at **EV Buddy**.  
- **[Nov. 2025]** Appointed **Machine Learning Lead** at **CRIZM**, overseeing AI-driven initiatives.  
- **[Nov. 2025]** Presented a research poster at the **Mid-Atlantic Section (MAS) ASEE Conference** on my CNN-based breast cancer detection model.  
- **[Aug. 2024]** Completed a Software Engineering internship at **JP Morgan Chase & Co.**, developing interactive trading dashboards and reducing onboarding time by 40%.  
- **[Aug. 2022]** Completed a System Operations internship at **iRobot**, leading robot design and reducing hardware–software interface failure rates by 20%.

  
## Projects

### Four-Stage Pipelined Multimedia Processor  
**Aug 2025 – Dec 2025**  

Designed a **four-stage pipelined processor (IF/ID/EX/WB)** using a structural RTL approach. Implemented a **128-bit multimedia ALU** for parallel processing of multiple subwords, a **32 × 128-bit register file** with multiple read and write ports, and a **forwarding unit** to prevent execution stalls. Built a **cycle-accurate testbench** and a **custom assembler** to verify the processor’s functionality.

### Transformer-Based NLP Chatbot with Intent Recognition  
**Jul 2025 – Aug 2025**  

Built a **transformer-based chatbot** that can understand and respond to multiple user intents. Created a **data pipeline** to prepare and process text for the model, including tokenization and embeddings. Developed a **simple interactive frontend** for real-time conversations. Applied **attention mechanisms and dropout** to improve accuracy and reliability. Tested the chatbot with various inputs to ensure it responds correctly.

### CNN-Based Breast Cancer Histopathology Classification  
**Jun 2025 – Jul 2025**  

Developed a **CNN in PyTorch** to classify breast cancer tissue images, achieving **95.9% training accuracy**. Designed the network with multiple **convolutional and pooling layers** to automatically extract important features from high-resolution images. Built a **Gradio interface** for users to upload images and see predictions with highlighted regions that influenced the results. Created a **training workflow** with data augmentation and normalization to improve the model’s performance.

## Beyond Academics

Outside of coursework and research, I enjoy spending time on things that help me stay balanced and energized. I like going to the gym and playing basketball, which keep me active and focused. I also enjoy playing chess, as it challenges the way I think and approach problems. In my free time, I like watching anime and traveling whenever I get the opportunity. Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures gives me fresh perspectives and keeps me inspired.


## Advice

I am very grateful for the advice, talks, essays, and ideas I have read, watched, and learned from over the years. Many of them come from people I deeply admire and have shaped my philosophy, how I approach problems, and how I want to live my life. A common theme across all of them is the importance of **continuous improvement**.

This aligns closely with the Japanese concept of **Kaizen (改善)** — the practice of making **small, consistent improvements over time**. Whether in research, learning, fitness, or life, Kaizen reminds me that meaningful progress comes from steady effort rather than sudden breakthroughs.
