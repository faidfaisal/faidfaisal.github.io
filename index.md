## About Me

Hi there! I'm an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Stony Brook University. I'm very fortunate to be advised by Professor [Jorge-Mendez Mendez](https://jorge-a-mendez.github.io/) in the Learning & Intelligence Lab, and Professor [Yi Liu](https://jacoblau0513.github.io/) in the AIRS Lab.   
 
Currently, I'm interested in Generative Models such as using LLMs to assist drug discovery and Diffusion Models at generating action parameters to successfully execute long-shot plans for Robots. 
  
I plan to pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science because I want to make AI algorithms to do tasks that couldn't be done before and can make positive impacts 

## Research Goals 

- **Embodied Intelligence:** How machines perceive/understand the world around it, and how it can make decisions in this situation? 
- **Generative Intelligence:** How to utilize generative models to support decision-making and inference? 

## News

- **[Apr. 2025]** I was accepted into the [URECA Summer Research Program](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ureca/summer/on-campusopportunities.php) at Stony Brook University for Summer of 2025. I will receive funding for my project on using Diffusion Models to assist plan execution of Robots in simulator environments and will be presenting this in the April 2026 Symposium! 
- **[Apr. 2025]** I was invited as a student presenter at the [2nd Annual SUNY AI Symposium](https://www.buffalo.edu/research/landing-pages/suny-ai-symposium.html) hosted in University of Buffalo! I presented by summer research poster and met many professors and PhD students. 
- **[Aug. 2024]** Completed my first Summer Research Program [SOAR](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/cie/suny-soar/index.php) at Stony Brook University funded by SUNY. My project utilized Neural Operators for weather forecasting in the United States.
