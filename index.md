## About Me

Hi there! I’m a third-year undergraduate student studying **Computer Engineering at Stony Brook University**. I’m very fortunate to be advised by **[Professor Alex Doboli](https://www.ece.stonybrook.edu/~adoboli/)**, where I am currently working on developing **machine learning and NLP algorithms** to assist with **student grading, automation, and instructional support systems**.

My academic interests are centered on the **intersection of machine learning, computer architecture, and embedded systems**. I am particularly interested in building systems where learning algorithms are tightly integrated with hardware to improve performance, efficiency, and scalability.

I plan to pursue a **PhD in Computer Engineering** and continue research in **artificial intelligence and machine learning**, motivated by a strong interest in understanding how intelligent algorithms can be designed, optimized, and deployed within real computing systems.

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning × Hardware:** How can machine learning algorithms be co-designed with hardware to improve efficiency, scalability, and performance?
- **Computer Architecture:** How do architectural choices in processors and memory systems impact the execution of modern ML workloads?
- **Embedded Systems:** How can intelligent algorithms be deployed on resource-constrained embedded platforms for real-world applications?
- **ML-Driven Systems:** How can learning-based approaches enhance automation, decision-making, and system-level optimization?

## News

- **[Dec. 2025]** Accepted a **Test Engineering Intern** offer at **EV Buddy**.  
- **[Nov. 2025]** Appointed **Machine Learning Lead** at **CRIZM**, overseeing AI-driven initiatives.  
- **[Nov. 2025]** Presented a research poster at the **Mid-Atlantic Section (MAS) ASEE Conference** on my CNN-based breast cancer detection model.  
- **[Aug. 2024]** Completed a Software Engineering internship at **JP Morgan Chase & Co.**, developing interactive trading dashboards and reducing onboarding time by 40%.  
- **[Aug. 2022]** Completed a System Operations internship at **iRobot**, leading robot design and reducing hardware–software interface failure rates by 20%.

  
## Projects

### Four-Stage Pipelined Multimedia Processor  
**Aug 2024 – Dec 2024**  

Designed a **four-stage pipelined processor (IF/ID/EX/WB)** using a structural RTL approach. Implemented a **128-bit multimedia ALU** with packed subword parallelism, a **32 × 128-bit register file** with three read ports and one write port, and a **hazard-free forwarding unit** enabling stall-free execution. Built a **cycle-accurate testbench**, instruction buffer, and a **custom assembler** for verification.

### Transformer-Based NLP Chatbot with Intent Recognition  
**Jul 2024 – Aug 2024**  

Trained a **transformer model with multi-headed attention**, achieving **80% accuracy** in intent classification. Designed a complete **data preprocessing pipeline**, including tokenization, embedding, and sequence padding. Built a **lightweight interactive frontend** for real-time conversational inference and integrated the model for multi-intent recognition. Implemented **attention masking and dropout regularization** to improve model generalization and prevent overfitting. Conducted extensive testing with a synthetic dataset and real conversational inputs to validate performance.

### CNN-Based Breast Cancer Histopathology Classification  
**Jun 2024 – Jul 2024**  

Developed a **custom CNN in PyTorch** for binary classification of breast cancer histopathology slides, achieving **95.9% training accuracy**. Designed a network with **multiple convolutional and pooling layers** to extract hierarchical features from high-resolution images and applied **regularization techniques** to reduce overfitting. Built an **interactive Gradio interface** to allow real-time image upload and prediction visualization, highlighting the regions contributing most to the model’s decisions. Created a **training and evaluation pipeline** with data augmentation, normalization, and batch management to ensure robust performance.

## Beyond Academics

Outside of coursework and research, I enjoy spending time on things that help me stay balanced and energized. I like going to the gym and playing basketball, which keep me active and focused. I also enjoy playing chess, as it challenges the way I think and approach problems. In my free time, I like watching anime and traveling whenever I get the opportunity. Exploring new places and experiencing different cultures gives me fresh perspectives and keeps me inspired.


## Advice

I am very grateful for the advice, talks, essays, and ideas I have read, watched, and learned from over the years. Many of them come from people I deeply admire and have shaped my philosophy, how I approach problems, and how I want to live my life. A common theme across all of them is the importance of **continuous improvement**.

This aligns closely with the Japanese concept of **Kaizen (改善)** — the practice of making **small, consistent improvements over time**. Whether in research, learning, fitness, or life, Kaizen reminds me that meaningful progress comes from steady effort rather than sudden breakthroughs.
